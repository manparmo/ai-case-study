# TITLE

## Overview and Origin

Cisco Systems was founded in late 1984 by Leonard Bosack and Sandy Lerner, two Stanford University commputer scientists that started the concept of Local Area Networks, a construct used today to allow you to write this report in github and to connect from your house to Amazon to get any shopping done, in other words it is everywhere. The company started on Standford's resources which lead the lead the founders to leave the university to pursue further growth. 

## Business Activities

Cisco allowed customer to create computer networks, which today is the most taken for granted resource in technology, usually large and medium corporations are the core consumer of Cisco's networking products, a market share of 43% of the entenrpise networks means that it is a well known player in the IT industry, notably it's ability to make key adquisicions has made Cisco succesful in getting into the right side of technology wave and ride it profitably, besides this, providing top technical support, has made Cisco unique against it's competitors.

Cisco is involved in multiple technology verticals, Quamtum computing and Networking, Security, Wireless, Enterprise Routing and Switching, Collaboration and lately applying AI technologies to its core products in an effort to operationalize the administration and configuration of many of them and to enhance them with the spirit of competing with other vendors.

## Landscape

Cisco is a key player in the telecomunications field, but also involved many other technology fields that run in parallel with telecomunications in the IT world, among them: Storage, Collaboration, Contact Center, Security, Hardware Servers, Application Monitoring, Application Performance and Analysis, IP Television, Application Virtualization and Modernization and many others, overall Information technology would be the best way to describe it's focus, however this has led  several other ventures in dissimilar fields like the creation of financial products for the purposes of funding the adquisition of its own technology to well known international clients, to the intervention as the premier technology and tecnical consulting services provider to the armed forces of different countries during recent conflicts, by embedding with said armed forces as a partner that ensures their combat readiness and ability to carry the fight to the enemy (Iraq and Ukraine conflicts for example).

Recently as of this year, Cisco has jumped in the AI bandwagon as measure to stay competitive.

The biggest trend that Cisco has moved to is the embracement of  Cloud solutions, historically speaking, Cisco has had a major commitment to on-prem networks, give the digital transformation happening today not jumping on the Cloud wagon would have meant technological stagnation and lack of competitiveness with offerings provided by other vendors in the telecomunications world, transition of it's core products to AI enablement has been the second trend driven by Cisco, this is quite recent, to the point that only a few of its core products have embedded AI solutions and most of the innovations are demonstrated with 3rd party or opensource AI Models that enhance their current telecomunications proucts. There is a nascient effort to push towards quantum networks based on the principles of quantum physics to increase bandwidth throuput and distance.

Cisco has strong competition in every technology vertical it is involved with, in the Enterprise Networking it is Juniper in the US and Huawei internationally, in the security vertical Fortinent and Checkpoint, in the Collaboration world Microsoft and NiceCX, in the Server Hardware HP and Dell, in Application Monitoring and Performance Nagios and Dynatrace, DataDog.

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?

As a public traded company, their measurements are mostly financial (Year over Year Net Income), Net Income, however, there are aspirational goals  that Cisco as has set like the Global impact initiative, where the goal was to impact positively over a billion people around the world through Cisco technology and educational efforts to lift people out of poverty.


* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
